# Simple Mind Mapper
A simple but flexible web-based tool to visualize relationships between ideas.

## Motivation
Almost all mind mapping software is hierarchy-based, meaning that certain relationships cannot be established (child/child, child/"grandparent", child/"uncle", and so forth). This project aims to provide a simple, easy-to-use, fast alternative which offers that additional flexibility.
